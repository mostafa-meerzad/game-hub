## 📚 Project Background

This project is the final result of [Mosh Hamedani’s React 18 Mastery Course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react), where I deeply learned component architecture, clean code practices, hooks, and modern React patterns. This app changed how I think about building React projects.

It was a fun and rewarding experience! 😄🎉
